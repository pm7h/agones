## Next Steps:

- Read the various references, including the [GameServer]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserver.md" >}}) and [Fleet]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/fleet.md" >}}) reference materials.
- Review the specifics of [Health Checking]({{< relref "health-checking.md" >}}).
- See all the commands the [Client SDK]({{< relref "Client SDKs/_index.md" >}}) provides - we only show a few here!
- If you aren't familiar with the term [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), this should provide a reference.
